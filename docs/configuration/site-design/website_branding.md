## Website Branding

In the website branding admin will be able to select colors for different sections of the website and also it will allow admin to select a theme. 

1. **Primary Color:** In the "Primary Color" section, administrators can choose a primary color tone for the entire website. By clicking on the field, a small window will open, allowing admins to select the desired color from a color picker tool. This customization feature enables administrators to establish a consistent color scheme throughout the website.
