1. **Allow External Sign up: **This setting enables you to decide whether users should have the ability to register and become members of your organization. This setting gives you control over the registration process and user access.

2. **Enable OTP:**  ‚ÄùEnable OTP" lets admin add extra security to user logins. When turned on, users will need to provide an extra code (OTP sent to their registered email or mobile phone) along with their password. This makes it much harder for unauthorized people to access accounts.

3. **Single Session:** "Single Session" allows admin to decide if he wants to stop users from being logged in from different places/ devices at the same time. When activated, it ensures that a user can only be logged in from one location/device at a time, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.

4. **SMTP:** "SMTP" allows you to personalize how your app sends emails. By providing your company's SMTP details, you can adjust the sender's email address and other email settings. This ensures that the emails sent from your app are in line with your company's identity and communication preferences.
