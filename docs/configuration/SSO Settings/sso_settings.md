## SSO Settings

The next widget available is the "SSO Settings" widget, which is designed to manage Single Sign-On (SSO) configurations for the site. With this widget, administrators can view and add SSO configurations.

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a user authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of login credentials. Instead of using separate usernames and passwords for each application, SSO enables users to log in once and gain access to all connected services without the need for repeated authentication.

The SSO Settings widget can be found under the Configurations tab, as shown above.
