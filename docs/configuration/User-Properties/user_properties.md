## User Properties

User Properties are a feature that allows you to attach custom attributes or information to individual user accounts within the system. These properties serve as additional fields where you can store specific data related to each user, tailoring it to your organization's needs.

For instance, you might want to create a user property called "Department" to categorize users based on the department they belong to within the organization. Another example could be a property named "Location," indicating the location each user is associated with.
The great advantage of user properties lies in their flexibility and adaptability. You can define these properties according to your unique requirements and business processes. Furthermore, user properties can be mapped to corresponding organization-wide properties, streamlining the process of importing and managing user data effectively.

The User Properties widget can be found under the Configurations tab, as shown below.

User properties enable us to add custom fields that capture specific details about each user, enabling better organization, segmentation, and personalized management within your application or system.
