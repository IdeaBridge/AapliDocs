## Company Information

The "Company Information" option in the company profile allows you to add or edit various details related to the company's address, billing information, phone number, and email address. To modify any of these details, simply click on the edit icon displayed in the respective section, as shown in the accompanying image. This will allow you to make the necessary changes to the company's information.

In the "Company Information" section, you have the option to input or modify both the Company Address and the Billing Address.

1. **Company Address:** In this section, you must provide the following details: Company Address, City, State, Pincode, and Country.
2. **Billing Address:** To simplify the process, there is a convenient checkbox labeled "Same as Company Address." When this box is selected, the billing address will automatically be set to match the company address.

However, if the billing address differs from the company address, simply leave the checkbox unselected and proceed to enter the specific Billing Address details, including City, State, Pincode, and Country.

Clicking on **Save** bottom will save the Company information. 



By offering this flexibility, you can easily manage both addresses based on your preferences and needs.
