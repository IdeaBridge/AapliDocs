## User Import Mapping

The Map User Properties Section helps match user details with the way your organization names those details. This is especially important when you get information from sources like Microsoft Active Directory. This matching process is crucial when you bring in user data, making sure everything fits together smoothly. When you use this widget, it becomes easier to put user data in the right place, keeping everything organized and accurate as you import user information into your system.
