## Actions:

This column offers Edit, Disable/Enable and Delete actions for Roles. Whenever the mouse pointer is hovered over a specific role in the list, corresponding action icons will appear under the Actions column.

## 1. Edit: 
The "Edit" action allows administrators with the appropriate permissions to modify a role.

When you click on the "Edit" icon under the "Actions" column for a particular role, a rightside window appears, allowing you to update the role's name, and the code.

## 2. Disable/Enable:

The "Disable/Enable" action lets you enable or disable a role as needed. When a role is disabled, it means that users assigned to this role will temporarily lose the associated privileges until the role is activated again. This action is useful when you want to temporarily suspend the role's functionality without deleting it entirely.

## 3. Delete:

The "Delete" action enables you to remove a role from the system. When you click on the "Delete" icon or link under the "Actions" column for a specific role, a confirmation prompt may appear to ensure that you want to proceed with the deletion.

Deleting a role will revoke all the privileges associated with it, and any users assigned to this role may lose their permissions accordingly.
