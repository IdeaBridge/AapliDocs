The Role Panel provides the following options:

1.**Add:** This option enables the admin to create a new Role by entering the necessary details and information.

2.**List of Existing Roles:** The panel displays list of all the roles that currently exist in the system. The list is presented in tabular form, with columns for Name, Code, Status, and Actions.

3.**Name:** The Name column showcases the names of the different roles available in the system.

4.**Code:** In this column, the respective Code names associated with each role are displayed.

5.**Status:** The Status column indicates whether each role is currently enabled or disabled.

6.**Actions:** This column offers several actions for role. The available actions include:

I. **Edit:** This action allows the admin to modify the details of an existing role.

II. **Disable/Enable:** By using this action, the admin can toggle the status of a role, enabling or disabling it as needed.

III. **Delete:** This action permits the admin to remove a role from the system altogether.

Whenever the admin hovers the mouse pointer over a specific role in the list, corresponding action icons will appear under the Actions column, providing a quick and efficient way to manage the roles.
