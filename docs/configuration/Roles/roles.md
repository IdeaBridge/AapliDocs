## Roles 
Under the Configurations tab, the next widget is Roles, which enables administrators to create and manage various roles along with their associated privileges. Using this widget, administrators can define roles for different user groups or positions within the organization and allocate specific permissions  to each role.

Roles are used to define sets of permissions or access levels that can be assigned to users, controlling what actions they can perform within the application.
