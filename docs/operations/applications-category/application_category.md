Application Category
The application category feature allows users to create and define categories in which applications can be created. This feature helps in configuring application categories so that applications can be organized and managed more efficiently.

By defining application categories, users can group related applications together and easily find them when needed. This is particularly useful when managing a large number of applications. Users can create categories based on different criteria, such as application type, department, or function.
