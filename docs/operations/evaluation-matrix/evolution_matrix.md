The Evolution Matrix widget under the Operations tab enables you to create and manage a set of evolution matrices. Within each matrix, you can define evolution criteria and establish their hierarchy. This feature provides a structured way to organize and analyze the criteria that drive the evolution of concepts or ideas, helping you track their progress and assess their development.
