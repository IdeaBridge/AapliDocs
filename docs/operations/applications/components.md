**Form** 
The Form tab allows users to create a comprehensive application layout using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This tab allows you to drag and drop inputs, add dates, currencies, attach files, background images, and music to create a comprehensive application layout that meets the requirements of the application. 

**Components**: 
To design the application layout, we can drag and drop the desired components from the left-hand pane into the middle pane. In order to create a form that fulfills the application's requirements, we have the flexibility to utilize input types such as single-line or multi-line text, drop-down menus, and radio buttons etc. Users can click on any of the required Components and drag it into the middle pane as per the applications requirement
