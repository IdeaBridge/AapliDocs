The "Bulk add" option provides a way for users to add multiple users to the system at once, rather than adding users one by one. This option simplifies the process of adding users, making it faster and more efficient.

2.	Users can enter user details such as title, first name, last name, email address, and recent applications in the downloaded Excel file
3.	Once all the user information is entered, users can save the Excel file on their computer
4.	To add bulk users, users can access the "Bulk add" option in the Users widget on the aapli site
5.	Users can then click on the "Bulk add" option and select the saved Excel file containing all user information from their computer
