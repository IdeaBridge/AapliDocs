## Users

Managing user accounts is a critical aspect of any platform, and aapli makes it easy with the “Users” widget. This widget provides a centralized location for creating and managing user accounts, allowing you to control who has access to your platform and what they can do. From this page, you can add new users, edit existing ones, and control their roles and permissions. 

Additionally, the Users widget displays a complete list of all existing users, making it simple to keep track of who has access to your platform. In this guide, we'll provide a detailed overview of the Users widget, so you can get the most out of this powerful tool.
