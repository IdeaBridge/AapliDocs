## Menu

Menu sections allows us to add and manage page navigations.  In a website or application, the header typically contains navigation elements, including menu items. These menu items serve as links to various pages, applications, or external websites. We can add various pages, applications, or external websites using the menu option. Menu option can be found under the Operations tab in Admin panel.
