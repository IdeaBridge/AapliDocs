3. **Comments:** Users can post remarks to the content owner via comments. These comments are visible to all members who have access to the application view.

4. **Similar Content:** This feature displays content closely matching the submitted content and assigns a similarity score.

When using the “Similar Content” feature, you have the option to set a minimum threshold for the similarity score. By doing so, you can filter the results and only display content that meets or exceeds your specified percentage match. This ensures that you receive relevant and closely related information.

## Application Views:

In Application Views tab, you have the option to change how your applications landing page looks by picking from different view options. Depending on your preference, you can show your content in a Grid View, which arranges your applications in rows and columns, or a List View, which shows your applications one below the other. You can also use both views or none at all.

**Card View**
{% include image.html file="imag29.jpg" class="docimage" url="https://admin-dev.aapli.app/form-builder" alt="Application Category" caption="Application Category" %}

If you want to present information in a way that is easy to read and understand, you should use card view. Card view is a design pattern that shows information in small, rectangular cards that have a clear and consistent layout. 

Each card can contain elements like Application Name, Application category, Creator’s name and Profile picture, created date, Status of the application and number of Comments and likes or ratings. Card view is ideal for displaying information that has different levels of importance or relevance, because users can quickly scan the cards and focus on the ones that interest them. Card view also makes the information more attractive and engaging, because it uses visual cues and hierarchy to highlight the key details.

**List View**

When users need to access and compare a lot of data that belongs to the same category, list view is an ideal option. List view displays data in rows and columns, allowing users to sort and filter the data according to different criteria. List view also enables users to scan the data quickly and efficiently, as they can see multiple items at once and focus on the most relevant information. List view is especially useful for complex or dynamic data sets that require frequent updates or changes.

One of the features of aapli is that you can customize the way you view the Applications. On the right-hand side of the page, you will see a dropdown menu that lets you choose which columns you want to see. You can select from the following options: Title, Description, Comments, Followers, Likes, Profile Picture, Created By, Created Date, and Status. These columns will show you different information about each Application, such as the title of the Application, a brief summary of its content, the number of comments it has received, the number of people who follow it, the number of likes it has earned, the profile picture of the Creator, the name of the Creator, the date when the post was created, and the current status of the post (e.g., Submitted, Approved etc.).
