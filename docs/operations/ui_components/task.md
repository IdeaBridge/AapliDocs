The next component in the list is called tasks. This component allows you to create tasks that are related to the form you are working on. You can assign these tasks to different users who have access to the form. For example, you can create a task to review the form, assign it to a supervisor, and set a deadline for completion. Tasks help you manage the workflow of your form and track its progress.

**Properties of Tasks**
**General**
Tasks are a way to collect and organize data in a form. You can customize the following general properties for each Task:
1. Field Label: This is the name of the Task that will show up on the form. You can change it to match your purpose.
2. Placeholder text: This is the text that will appear inside the Task field before the user enters any data. You can use it to give an example or a hint.
3. Help Text: This is the text that will appear below the Task field to provide more instructions or guidance to the user.
4. Tooltip: This is the text that will appear when the user hovers over the Task field with their mouse cursor. You can use it to give a brief description or explanation of the Task.
5. Enable Duplicate: This is a checkbox that lets you choose whether to allow or prevent the user from selecting the same Task more than once in the form.
6. Index Number: This is a checkbox that appears when you enable duplicate Tasks. It assigns a number to each Task selection to help you sort and reference them later.
7. Allow Attachment: This is a checkbox that lets you enable or disable the option for the user to attach files within the Task field.
